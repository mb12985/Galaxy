==================================
Galaxy Core Governance
==================================

This document informally outlines the organizational structure governing the
Galaxy core code base hosted at https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy. This
governance extends to code-related activities of this repository such as
releases and packaging. This governance does not include infrastructure such
as Galaxy's Trello board, the Galaxy mailing lists, etc... or other Galaxy-
related projects belonging to the ``galaxyproject`` organization on GitHub.

Committers
==========

The `committers` group is the group of trusted developers and advocates who
manage the core Galaxy code base. They assume many roles required to achieve
the project's goals, especially those that require a high level of trust.

Galaxy Project `committers` are the only individuals who may commit to the
core Galaxy code base. All commits must be made in accordance with procedures
outlined in Galaxy's CONTRIBUTING_ document. In particular, in most cases
direct commit access is not allowed and this access is restricted to merging
pull requests issued by others.

Committers may participate in formal votes - these votes typically include
votes to modify team membership, merge pull requests, and modify or clarify
the procedures outlined in this document and CONTRIBUTING_.

Membership
----------

The `committers` group was seeded with the group of active developers and
advocates with commit access to the repository as of May 2015. This group
subsequently voted in new members.

Any member of the `committers` group may nominate an individual for membership
to the `committers` group. Such individuals must have demonstrated:

- Good grasp of the design of Galaxy core project.
- Solid track record of being constructive and helpful.
- Significant contributions to the project.
- Willingness to dedicate some time to improving Galaxy.

The above list of `committers` is the canonical source used to determine
membership to the `committers` group - as such new members may be added to
this group by opening a pull request adding a qualified person to this list.
Pull requests modifying the membership of this list are subject to the normal
rules for pull requests that modify governance procedures outlined in Galaxy's
CONTRIBUTING_ document - with one exception - a `commmitter` may not vote
against their own removal from the group (for obvious reasons).

Given the responsibilities and power invested in this group - it is important
that individuals not actively working on Galaxy in some fashion are removed from
the group. If individuals in this group intend to change jobs or reallocate
volunteer activities and will no longer be active in the Galaxy community,
they should withdraw from membership of this group. Periodically, active
members may review this group and request inactive members are removed - this
should not be interpreted as a condemnation of these inactive members but
merely as a reflection of a desire to keep this group focused enough to remain
effective.
